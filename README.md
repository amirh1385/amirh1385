### Why This Stack?

- **Frontend**: React along with **Tailwind CSS** makes the UI fast and responsive, and on the other hand, **React** with its high performance helps to create a smooth and flexible application.
  
- **Backend**: Using **Laravel** as the PHP framework accelerates development and supports MVC architecture very well. This framework provides powerful features such as authentication management, database migrations, and more.

- **Database**: I use **MySQL** as the main database, which works well with structured data and is suitable for various scales.

- **Caching & Authentication**: I use **Redis** for caching, which speeds up request handling. I also use **JWT** for authentication in API projects.

- **Containerization**: Projects are containerized using **Docker** for easier execution across different environments.
