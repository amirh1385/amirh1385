### Why This Stack?

- **Frontend**: **React** helps in building fast and smooth applications, and it's highly flexible for UI development. I use **Bootstrap** for a simple and responsive layout structure.

- **Backend**: Using **Laravel** as the PHP framework accelerates development and supports the MVC architecture well. It offers powerful features such as authentication management, database migrations, and more.

- **Database**: I use **MySQL** as the main database, which works well with structured data and is suitable for various scales.

- **Caching**: I use **Redis** for caching, which helps speed up request handling.
